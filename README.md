## Python keylogger
#### Description
The Python code implements a keylogger that captures keyboard input and sends it to a server at regular intervals. It uses the pynput library to monitor keyboard events and requests to send HTTP POST requests containing the captured text. The JavaScript code sets up a server using the express framework, which listens for HTTP POST requests and logs the keyboard data to a file. It also serves a simple HTML page to display the logged data.
#### Tools & Technologies Used
Python: A high-level programming language used for the keylogger script.

pynput: A library for capturing keyboard events.
requests: A library for making HTTP requests.
threading: A Python module for running tasks concurrently.
JavaScript: A programming language used for the server-side script.

express: A web framework for Node.js to create the HTTP server.
body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON bodies of incoming requests.
fs (File System): Node.js module for file operations.
Process
Python Keylogger:

Initialization: Sets up a text variable to store captured keystrokes and defines the serverâ€™s IP address and port number.
Key Capture: Uses pynput's keyboard.Listener to capture key presses and update the text variable accordingly.
Data Posting: Sends the captured text to the server via a POST request every 10 seconds using the requests library.
Exception Handling: Prints an error message if the POST request fails.
Termination: Stops capturing when the Esc key is pressed.
JavaScript Server:

Setup: Initializes an Express application and configures it to parse JSON request bodies.
HTTP GET: Serves an HTML page that displays the contents of keyboard_capture.txt if it exists.
HTTP POST: Receives keyboard data from the Python script and writes it to keyboard_capture.txt.
Error Handling: Responds with a default message if no data is logged yet.
#### Testing & Results
##### Testing:

Python Code: Run the Python script to ensure it starts capturing keystrokes and sending data to the server. Verify that the data is correctly sent every 10 seconds.
JavaScript Server: Start the server and make sure it listens on port 8080. Test the GET request by navigating to http://localhost:8080 to ensure it displays the logged data. Test the POST request by running the Python script to check if the data is properly received and saved.
##### Results:

The Python script successfully captures keystrokes and posts them to the server.
The JavaScript server correctly logs the data to a file and serves it via HTTP GET requests.
The HTML page displays the logged keyboard data as expected.
#### Conclusion
The integration of the Python keylogger and JavaScript server demonstrates a basic setup for capturing and displaying keyboard input. The Python script handles the keylogging and data transmission, while the JavaScript server manages data storage and presentation. This setup provides a clear example of how to capture user input and communicate between a client-side application and a server. However, this implementation should be used with caution and only in environments where you have explicit permission, as keylogging can be sensitive and potentially harmful if misused.
